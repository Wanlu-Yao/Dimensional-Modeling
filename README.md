# SQL-Dimensional-Modeling
The purpose of this project is to create a data warehouse for the organization, then retrieve the information of top 10 Hospitals/Medical Centers that have SICUs (Surgical Intensive Cate Units) and ICUs (Intensive Care Units) for the following categories of "beds”: licensed beds, census beds, and staffed beds as instructed. 
There are three datasets are supplied to address the request, and two of them are dimension tables and one is the fact table. The fist dimension table contains 2,3147 rows and 6 columns that record the information about the different hospitals, such as organization ID, name, and total number of beds for each category. The second dimension table has 20 rows and 3 attributes that describe the type of bed such as bed ID, bed code, and the belonged departments. Finally, the fact table consists facts of the business process like organization ID and bed ID with 5,3770 rows and 5 columns.
To address the issue, I’ll implement a star schema in MySQL Workbench to identify the dimensions and facts. Then I am going to create a ER Diagram using an online tool called ERDPlus to visualize the structure. Lastly, I will insert the data into each table, and design SQL queries to indicate the total counts of each bed type for each department in the Top 10 hospitals.
